/**
 * page-canvas-host.tsx
 *
 * Renders a single PDF page as a READ-ONLY bitmap onto its own pooled
 * `fabric.Canvas` for the Word-like continuous editor view. Each host:
 *
 *   1. mounts one `<canvas>` sized to the page (points × scale, rotation-aware);
 *   2. acquires a recycled `fabric.Canvas` from the shared {@link PageRenderPool};
 *   3. paints the FULL PDF background (with text) at index 0 via the shared
 *      `addPdfBackground`;
 *   4. releases its pool slot on unmount.
 *
 * This host is used ONLY for INACTIVE pages in the continuous scroller — the
 * cheap, pixel-perfect bitmap. The ACTIVE/focused page renders a real embedded
 * `<EditorCanvas>` instead (full tooling: create/move/resize/retype/delete,
 * undo/redo, toolbar handle), so the editable overlay lives there, never here.
