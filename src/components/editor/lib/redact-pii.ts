/**
 * redact-pii.ts
 *
 * Client-side helper for the editor's PII redaction tool.
 *
 * Redaction is a **true, irreversible** operation baked onto the PDF through the
 * shared GigaPDF engine ({@link loadPdfEngine} — the same single wasm instance
 * that rasterises page backgrounds and bakes headers/footers, so we never load a
 * second engine). For each page the engine's {@link redactPii} deletes the
 * overlapping text/vector content from the content stream (glyphs + their
 * `/ToUnicode` mapping are gone — copy/paste and text extraction reveal nothing),
 * overwrites the pixels of any underlying image with opaque black (re-encoded, so
 * the sensitive bytes are erased, not merely covered), strips overlapping
 * annotations, and paints an opaque black box as the visible redaction mark.
 *
 * The flow mirrors {@link file://./page-headers-footers.ts}:
 *
 *   - the user draws redaction zones on the editor canvas (web coordinates,
 *     origin top-left, Y-down, in PDF points at scale 1);
 *   - {@link webRectToPdf} lowers each web rect into PDF user-space (origin
 *     bottom-left, Y-up), honouring the page's `/Rotate` flag;
 *   - {@link groupRectsByPage} buckets the converted rects per 1-based page;
 *   - {@link redactDocument} opens a short-lived `GigaPdfDoc` on the shared
 *     engine, calls `redactPii` once per page that has rects, re-serialises, and
 *     closes the doc in `finally`.
 *
 * The caller feeds the returned bytes back into the editor's single source of
 * truth (`currentPdfFile`) via `adoptModifiedPdf` — exactly like any other
 * full-binary operation. No React, no DOM — trivially unit-testable with an
 * injected engine loader.
